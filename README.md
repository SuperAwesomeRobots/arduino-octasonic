# arduino-octasonic

Arduino library and firmware for Octasonic breakout board.

## Connecting the board

Connect the Octasonic pins to Arduino Uno pins as follows

```

## Installing this library

There are lots of good tutorials on the internet about installing Arduino libraries so I suggest searching for those. Hoever, the short version is that recent versions of the Arduino IDE have a menu option for installing libraries and that is the easiest approach. Simply download a zip of this repository (there is a 'Download ZIP' button near the top right of this page) and then import that into the IDE.
